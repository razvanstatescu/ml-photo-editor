# Photo editor using Machine Learning 

This repository is associated with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/GJqBC7QiBk0).

In [this](https://youtu.be/GJqBC7QiBk0) video we made a photo editor from scratch using NodeJS. 
We ueed [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with the [BodyPix model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix) to do body segmentation.
Then, we used [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) to edit the photo and remove the background.
